## Start working on the problem
1. Sign in [Experimentor](https://experimentorx.mentoracademy.org) with your Coursera account.

## Install Python Packages

- There are some common packages installed in Experimentor. To check them, open a notebook and type the following:

- If the package you need is not on this list, you could install by typing:

    ```
    !pip install __packageX__
    ```

## What if the notebook is not working?

Since Experimentor is still a research prototype, it might run into issues. If the Python code in your notebook is not working, please try to restart the kernel. If it doesn't work out, or you experience other issues, please contact Anant via Slack or email.
