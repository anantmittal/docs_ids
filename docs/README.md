# Independent Data Science

> The goal of the study is to understand how data scientists work on a predictive modeling problem using Jupyter Notebook. You will join us with 2 remote sessions during this week for 2 hours each to work on a predictive modeling problem. 

## Timeline
<!-- Change the timeline for each group! -->
- Session 1: September 29, 8:00pm - 9:00pm, EST
- Break:  
- Session 2: October 6, 8:00pm - 9:00pm, EST

## Task Description
<!-- Change the link to overview, move other mds into /unreleased for session 0 -->
The problem description will be posted [here](overview.md) when the study starts. You should submit the following materials at the end of the study:

- A final report in Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- Prediction result on the test dataset

We are using a remote screensharing tool to collect data. You should walkthrough [session 0](session0.md) before the study to install the required tools.
