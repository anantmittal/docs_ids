### Setup Study Environment

- Make sure Chrome is installed on your computer
- Please turn on the Lookback extension for [session1](https://participate.lookback.io/ifqxKi?live) and wait for the research team to join

### How to Use Experimentor


##### Start working on the problem
1. Sign in [Experimentor](https://experimentorx.mentoracademy.org) with your Coursera account.

2. Open the `Problem Statement.ipynb` in `Problem-Statement-Folder` folder.

##### Install Python Packages

    ![](assets/list.jpg)

- If the package you need is not on this list, you could install by typing:

    ```
    !pip install __packageX__
    ```

##### What if the notebook is not working?

Since Experimentor is still a research prototype, it might run into issues. If the Python code in your notebook is not working, please try to restart the kernel. If it doesn't work out, or you experience other issues, please contact Anant via Slack or email.

### Goal for Session 1

In this session, you will use concepts such as feature engineering to solve the predictive modeling problem at hand.

### After Session 1
